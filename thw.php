UPDATE: (MARCH 13 2014): Now that The Hidden Wiki's private_key is public, I'm going to contribute to the further Balkanization of THW's userbase by not linking to anyone. Grab <a href="/misc/THW_private_key.txt">the key</a> here.<br /><br />

UPDATE (MARCH 11 2014): As you know by now, doxbin's repossession team has taken The Hidden Wiki's domain and now all of the traffic comes here. In the interest in not laying a critical deathblow to the community at large, this page will now be serving up links to Hidden Wiki clones who A. Don't link to child porn site and B. Allow community editing. If you've always wanted to run something like The Hidden Wiki, now's your chance! <a href="mailto:intangir@riseup.net">E-mail me</a> if you want to see your wiki here.<br /><br />

<p class="left">This message is directed at anyone who attempted to visit TheHiddenWiki and ended up on my site, doxbin! Over a year ago, doxbin appointed itself as judge, jury, and executioner for all matters relating to Onionland. Today, we made a decision that TheHiddenWiki wasn't good enough to own it's own onion, so we dispatched the doxbin repossession team to retrieve TheHiddenWiki's private_key and add it to our ever growing arsenal. To anyone mad at me due to your inability to find your hard candy (aka kiddie porn) fix somewhere else, I plan on updating this file periodically with a tally of how many attempts are made to visit the /Hard_Candy page.
