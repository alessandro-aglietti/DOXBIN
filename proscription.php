<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscription">Wikipedia</a>:<br /><br />

"<strong>Proscription</strong> (Latin: <em>proscriptio</em>) is the public identification and official condemnation of enemies of the state."<br /><br />

This is a list of various people who can be tormented at your leisure. If you're bored and feel like terrorizing some random person whose dox are on the site, this is a good place to start. Normally, I try to remain neutral to a fault, but these people have just proved bothersome for one reason or another. I really don't care how hard you go on any of them.</p>
