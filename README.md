# DOXBIN

Oh, how long it's been.

The earliest files in the doxbin archive date to 05/30/2011. After the pigs blew a 0day (See also: Operation Onymous) to get me and a bunch of wanna-be drug barons (And still couldn't catch me, LOL), I decided to sit back and observe. The infrequent cries for source code are the only thing I will choose to address today. This code was considered hideous by all who saw it when it was new, so don't expect to see anything worth using. The fact that I can toss this repo up should, at the very least, present a good case study for having offsite backups of everything. 

Note that this project only contains the PHP files needed to make the site run. If you intend to actually run this code, you're going to need a web server and PHP installed on a box (nginx + php-fpm is what I used). You'll also have to just read the source to figure out what directories to create. Why? Partly because I'm lazy and don't feel like doing it myself, but mostly because fuck full-on skid enabling, that's why.

As a bonus, I also threw in the PHP for an early (2011) version.

Always resting in undoxability,
